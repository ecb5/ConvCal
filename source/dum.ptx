          Isaac Newton Institute will begin with a workshop that is open both
          to in<ndash/>person seminar participants and online guests. Each speaker
          will respond to “What do you consider to be the most significant
          open question, or lacuna, in your area of the history of
          mathematics?” Registration is free for virtual participants, but it
          must be completed by 22 September 2024.

          The Isaac Newton Institute Modern History of Mathematics programme is holding a satellite event that will bring together stakeholders in the mathematical community (Heads of Department, Directors of Research, representatives of Learned Societies and Funding Bodies); organisations using history of mathematics in high<ndash/>level public engagement such as broadcasters and museums; and leading international mathematical historians of mathematics. The meeting will showcase the role, contribution, and potential of modern history of mathematics in mathematical research, teaching, public outreach and impact. Most participants will be invited by the organisers, but interested leaders can register at the link for the wait list.

          May 12 is the International Women in Mathematics Day, which was chosen to mark and celebrate the birthday of Maryam Mirzakhani, the first woman to win the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics, in 2014. In joining these celebrations all over the world, the leaders organize a symposium, which will address amongst others the following questions, but its topics will by no means be restricted within them:
          <ul>
            <li>
              How can we make sense of women mathematicians’ historical emergence as subjects of scientific knowledge, as well as creators of philosophy and culture?
            </li>
            <li>
              In what ways can memory work in the archives motivate young women and girls to re-imagine themselves as mathematicians in the future?
            </li>
          </ul>

          The CSHPM will hold its 2025 Annual Meeting in Toronto at George Brown College in conjunction with the 2025 Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences. The Kenneth O. May Lecturer for the Special Session will be Patricia Blanchette of the University of Notre Dame. Proposals are welcome for a Special Session on Conceptual Change in Mathematics and a General Session on all topics relevant to the history of mathematics, the philosophy of mathematics, or the use of history or philosophy in the teaching of mathematics. All talks are 20 minutes in length.

          An exciting training program for master’s students, doctoral candidates, and early<ndash/>career researchers focused on the history of astronomy will be held at the Paris Observatory. Participants will explore the latest developments in digital humanities and artificial intelligence as applied to the study of primary sources. A limited number of scholarships are available to support those who require financial assistance for travel and accommodation in Paris. Click the link above for details and application information before April 18.

                Workshop, <alert>We Integrate Differentials, Not
                Functions</alert>. The organizers propose that starting an
                Integral Calculus course by defining the integral as the
                limit of Riemann sums is not only historically inaccurate
                but more importantly, it is pedagogically unsound.  Rigor
                has its place but its place is not at the beginning of the
                course where it hinders students<rsq/> use of integration as
                a problem-solving tool.  This workshop will provide
                examples, problems, and approaches which will demonstrate
                the power of integrating differentials to solve (not
                necessarily calculus) problems.  It will also provide
                motivation for the study of power series and ultimately
                numerical series and sequences as approximation
                techniques. Rather than treating these as a separate topic,
                which is often the norm, they can serve to begin the
                <q>crossover</q> into the abstraction and rigor of Riemann
                sums and power series.
