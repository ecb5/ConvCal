              The workshop will bring together scholars and students
              alike, welcoming their diverse methodological
              backgrounds and perspectives. Our goal is to create an
              inclusive and diverse platform that fosters meaningful
              discussions on the social and cultural aspects of
              minorities and the sciences throughout different
              historical periods and cultures. By engaging in this
              multidisciplinary exploration, we hope to gain deeper
              insights into the complex interplay between scientific
              pursuits and minority experiences in the past. Deadline
              for the submission of abstracts: October 15,
              2023. Notification of acceptance by email: October 30,
              2023.

              The PASHoM seminar will meet virtually on Zoom for the
              spring semester (except the April talk, which will be
              hybrid), with one speaker each month. In the February
              talk <alert>Bonita Lawrence</alert>, Professor Emerita,
              Marshall University, will speak on <pubtitle>Solving
              Dynamic Equations: Using Gifts from the
              Past</pubtitle>. The Marshall Differential Analyzer
              Project developed from an idea sparked by a visit to the
              London Science Museum’s display of historic differential
              analyzer machines. The primary goal of the project was
              to offer an alternative perspective, and hence an
              enhanced understanding, of the behavior of solutions to
              dynamic equations. As our study and the construction of
              our machines progressed, we found that the dynamic
              motion of the machine’s components and the sounds
              created offered observers an amazing physical connection
              to the “programed” mathematical equation. Through the
              years, our machines have been used to teach students
              about modeling physical systems with dynamic equations,
              for research studies, and to offer prospective students
              an alternative view of our mathematical structure.This
              presentation will begin with some discussion of the
              history of the development of these machines and of our
              own project. A general overview of the primary
              components of the machine and the relationship between
              the mechanics and the mathematics being modeled will
              follow. The big finale will be a live streaming of a run
              of the large four integrator machine, complete with a
              discussion of the link between the physical connections
              between the components and the differential equation
              under consideration. All seminar talks will begin at
              6:30 pm ET.

      This conference aims to explore the different experiences of women in intellectual spheres and how these roles have developed over time. It commemorates the women whose complex relationships with higher education have shaped the experience of female scholars today and to acknowledge there is still work to be done. This call for papers is also a call for action. The call for papers is open until September 1st.
