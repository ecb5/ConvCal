              The workshop will bring together scholars and students
              alike, welcoming their diverse methodological
              backgrounds and perspectives. Our goal is to create an
              inclusive and diverse platform that fosters meaningful
              discussions on the social and cultural aspects of
              minorities and the sciences throughout different
              historical periods and cultures. By engaging in this
              multidisciplinary exploration, we hope to gain deeper
              insights into the complex interplay between scientific
              pursuits and minority experiences in the past. Deadline
              for the submission of abstracts: October 15,
              2023. Notification of acceptance by email: October 30,
              2023.

              The PASHoM seminar will meet virtually on Zoom for the
              spring semester (except the April talk, which will be
              hybrid), with one speaker each month. In the February
              talk <alert>Bonita Lawrence</alert>, Professor Emerita,
              Marshall University, will speak on <pubtitle>Solving
              Dynamic Equations: Using Gifts from the
              Past</pubtitle>. The Marshall Differential Analyzer
              Project developed from an idea sparked by a visit to the
              London Science Museum’s display of historic differential
              analyzer machines. The primary goal of the project was
              to offer an alternative perspective, and hence an
              enhanced understanding, of the behavior of solutions to
              dynamic equations. As our study and the construction of
              our machines progressed, we found that the dynamic
              motion of the machine’s components and the sounds
              created offered observers an amazing physical connection
              to the “programed” mathematical equation. Through the
              years, our machines have been used to teach students
              about modeling physical systems with dynamic equations,
              for research studies, and to offer prospective students
              an alternative view of our mathematical structure.This
              presentation will begin with some discussion of the
              history of the development of these machines and of our
              own project. A general overview of the primary
              components of the machine and the relationship between
              the mechanics and the mathematics being modeled will
              follow. The big finale will be a live streaming of a run
              of the large four integrator machine, complete with a
              discussion of the link between the physical connections
              between the components and the differential equation
              under consideration. All seminar talks will begin at
              6:30 pm ET.

      This conference aims to explore the different experiences of women in intellectual spheres and how these roles have developed over time. It commemorates the women whose complex relationships with higher education have shaped the experience of female scholars today and to acknowledge there is still work to be done. This call for papers is also a call for action. The call for papers is open until September 1st.

      The Society’s Annual Meeting will take place at McGill University in Montreal as part of Congress 2024 of the Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences. The special session, CSHPM at 50: Looking Back, Looking Ahead, celebrates the Society’s 50th anniversary. Papers may address the history and philosophy of mathematics in Canada or the CSHPM, or graduate students and early career scholars may discuss their contributions to the future of the history and philosophy of mathematics. The general session welcomes papers on any subject relating to the history of mathematics, its use in the teaching of mathematics, the philosophy of mathematics, or a related topic. Abstracts are due February 10, 2024.

      HPM 2024 is the eleventh quadrennial meeting of the HPM group, an affiliated study group of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction, ICMI. By combining the history of mathematics with the teaching and learning of mathematics, HPM connects the past and the future of mathematics. Therefore, the group aims to stress the conception of mathematics as a living science, a science with a long history, a vivid present, and an as yet unforeseen future. The program includes plenary lectures, panels, workshops, parallel sessions where participants present research reports, poster exhibitions, and exhibitions of books and other didactical material. Proposals for contributed talks, workshops and posters are due by the extended deadline of March 15, 2024, using the application form posted on the meeting website.

      The largest international conference on mathematics education in the world, this quadrennial event is organized under the auspices of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction and explores current global trends in mathematics education research and mathematics teaching practices at all levels. The program includes 54 Topic Study Groups (TSGs), including TSG 5.4: The Role of the History of Mathematics in Mathematics Education. Although the deadline for submitting TSG presentation proposals closed in fall 2023, all conference attendees are able to collaboratively explore classic and contemporary topics relevant to mathematics education by participating in these session-based discussions.

Workshop, <alert>Putting the Differential Back into Calculus</alert>, in which participants will learn to develop the differentiation rules in the manner of Leibniz (using differentials rather than limits). The workshop will compare and contrast solution methods using differentials with the modern approaches using the Derivative Calculus of Lagrange. The source material for the workshop’s activities will be drawn from the organizers’ OER Calculus textbook
