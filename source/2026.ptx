        <p>
          International Conference: <alert>Beyond Books: Instruments and Knowledge in Libraries</alert>, Musée d’histoire des sciences, Geneva
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays, most library users are unaware that for
          centuries, libraries have combined written and ‘hands-on’
          dimensions of knowledge by collecting instruments and
          objects of all kinds.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Middle Ages, library collections frequently
          included astrolabes, quadrants, and sundials alongside
          treatises explaining their construction and use. Theories
          of libraries in the Renaissance already anticipated the
          inclusion of ‘mathematical instruments’. With the
          emergence of curiosity cabinets, between the 16th and 18th
          centuries the array of objects was continuously
          extended. Libraries acquired more and more maps,
          portraits, coins, medals, natural specimens, models, and
          exotic artefacts intended to engage with and enrich the
          libraries’ vast encyclopaedic knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The presence of a cabinet and the interaction between
          instruments and books became a crucial material and
          epistemological concern in the management of libraries,
          whether private or ‘public’, from the 17th century
          onwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Objects were stored close to books, or in adjoining rooms,
          and fulfilled various functions. Instruments were regarded
          as both ornaments and complements to written knowledge,
          three-dimensional representations of knowledge that could
          be handled. They therefore played a crucial role in
          understanding scientific texts, serving as examples or as
          mnemotechnic tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the exception of a few studies, the presence of
          instruments in libraries has received little attention in
          the general history of libraries. The history of
          education, reading practices, architecture and
          institutions have taken precedence. The international
          conference Beyond Books: Instruments and Knowledge in
          Libraries aims to re-evaluate these historiographical
          assessments and reconnect libraries, instruments, and
          books. In a deliberately multidisciplinary and diachronic
          approach, the event will interrogate the acquisition,
          status and use of instruments in libraries across
          different time periods, geographical areas, and knowledge
          cultures.
