            May 12 is the International Women in Mathematics Day,
            which was chosen to mark and celebrate the birthday of
            Maryam Mirzakhani, the first woman to win the Fields
            Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics, in
            2014. In joining these celebrations all over the world,
            the leaders organize a symposium, which will address
            amongst others the following questions, but its topics
            will by no means be restricted within them:
            <ul>
              <li>
                How can we make sense of women mathematicians<rsq/>
                historical emergence as subjects of scientific
                knowledge, as well as creators of philosophy and
                culture?
              </li>
              <li>
                In what ways can memory work in the archives motivate
                young women and girls to re-imagine themselves as
                mathematicians in the future?

                  Workshop, <alert>We Integrate Differentials, Not
                  Functions</alert>. The organizers propose that starting an
                  Integral Calculus course by defining the integral as the
                  limit of Riemann sums is not only historically inaccurate
                  but more importantly, it is pedagogically unsound.  Rigor
                  has its place but its place is not at the beginning of the
                  course where it hinders students<rsq/> use of integration as
                  a problem-solving tool.  This workshop will provide
                  examples, problems, and approaches which will demonstrate
                  the power of integrating differentials to solve (not
                  necessarily calculus) problems.  It will also provide
                  motivation for the study of power series and ultimately
                  numerical series and sequences as approximation
                  techniques. Rather than treating these as a separate topic,
                  which is often the norm, they can serve to begin the
                  <q>crossover</q> into the abstraction and rigor of Riemann
                  sums and power series.

            March 2025 began the 80th anniversary year of the election
            of the first two female Fellows of the Royal Society –
            Kathleen Lonsdale and Marjory Stephenson. This anniversary
            year is being marked by a series of events looking at the
            past, present, and future of women in the scientific
            community. These will include a one-day history of science
            conference on 18 November 2025 and a two-day contemporary
            event in early 2026.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the historical section of this activity in November,
            we are interested in new research that reflects on
            contributions, exclusions and collaborations between women
            collectors, researchers and illustrators from the
            seventeenth century to the twentieth century. We envisage
            a half-day on earlier periods, followed by a half-day on
            nineteenth- and twentieth-century scientists that will pay
            particular attention to female Fellows of the Royal
            Society, candidates for Fellowship (actual and potential),
            those who published or exhibited at the Society, or those
            supported by Royal Society research grants. However,
            material reflecting on any aspect of women in science will
            be considered.
          </p>
          <p>
            We welcome proposals for 15 to 20<ndash/>minute papers on
            themes related to scientific women, including:
            <q>Hidden</q> or underappreciated individual figures in
            the history of science.  Intellectual networks, salons or
            societies led by women, whether local, national, or
            international.  Unrecognised contributions by the wives,
            sisters and daughters of male Fellows of the Royal
            Society.  The Royal Society’s own involvement in including
            or excluding women from scientific careers.  The role of
            twentieth-century women in STEM in gaining recognition and
            status both for their own contributions to science and
            those of other women.
          </p>

            Please submit proposals (not exceeding 300 words,

            International Conference: <alert>Beyond Books: Instruments and Knowledge in Libraries</alert>, Musée d’histoire des sciences, Geneva
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays, most library users are unaware that for
            centuries, libraries have combined written and ‘hands-on’
            dimensions of knowledge by collecting instruments and
            objects of all kinds.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Middle Ages, library collections frequently
            included astrolabes, quadrants, and sundials alongside
            treatises explaining their construction and use. Theories
            of libraries in the Renaissance already anticipated the
            inclusion of ‘mathematical instruments’. With the
            emergence of curiosity cabinets, between the 16th and 18th
            centuries the array of objects was continuously
            extended. Libraries acquired more and more maps,
            portraits, coins, medals, natural specimens, models, and
            exotic artefacts intended to engage with and enrich the
            libraries’ vast encyclopaedic knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            The presence of a cabinet and the interaction between
            instruments and books became a crucial material and
            epistemological concern in the management of libraries,
            whether private or ‘public’, from the 17th century
            onwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Objects were stored close to books, or in adjoining rooms,
            and fulfilled various functions. Instruments were regarded
            as both ornaments and complements to written knowledge,
            three-dimensional representations of knowledge that could
            be handled. They therefore played a crucial role in
            understanding scientific texts, serving as examples or as
            mnemotechnic tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the exception of a few studies, the presence of
            instruments in libraries has received little attention in
            the general history of libraries. The history of
            education, reading practices, architecture and
            institutions have taken precedence. The international
            conference Beyond Books: Instruments and Knowledge in
            Libraries aims to re-evaluate these historiographical
            assessments and reconnect libraries, instruments, and
            books. In a deliberately multidisciplinary and diachronic
            approach, the event will interrogate the acquisition,
            status and use of instruments in libraries across
            different time periods, geographical areas, and knowledge
            cultures.
          </p>
          <p>
