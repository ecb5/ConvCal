By engaging in this multidisciplinary exploration, we hope to gain deeper insights into the complex interplay between scientific pursuits and minority experiences in the past. Deadline for the submission of abstracts: October 15, 2023. Notification of acceptance by email: October 30, 2023.  Questions and abstracts should be addressed to Dr. Josefina Rodríguez-Arribas: rodriguezarribas@gmail.com    February 15, 2024   Philadelphia Area Seminar on the History of Mathematics (PASHoM) , Villanova University     The PASHoM seminar will meet virtually on Zoom for the spring semester (except the April talk, which will be hybrid), with one speaker each month. In the February talk Bonita Lawrence , Professor Emerita, Marshall University, will speak on Solving Dynamic Equations: Using Gifts from the Past . The Marshall Differential Analyzer Project developed from an idea sparked by a visit to the London Science Museum’s display of historic differential analyzer machines. The primary goal of the project was to offer an alternative perspective, and hence an enhanced understanding, of the behavior of solutions to dynamic equations. As our study and the construction of our machines progressed, we found that the dynamic motion of the machine’s components and the sounds created offered observers an amazing physical connection to the “programed” mathematical equation. Through the years, our machines have been used to teach students about modeling physical systems with dynamic equations, for research studies, and to offer prospective students an alternative view of our mathematical structure.This presentation will begin with some discussion of the history of the development of these machines and of our own project. A general overview of the primary components of the machine and the relationship between the mechanics and the mathematics being modeled will follow. The big finale will be a live streaming of a run of the large four integrator machine, complete with a discussion of the link between the physical connections between the components and the differential equation under consideration. All seminar talks will begin at 6:30 pm ET.  Contact Alan Gluchoff for parking or Zoom details.

Therefore, the group aims to stress the conception of mathematics as a living science, a science with a long history, a vivid present, and an as yet unforeseen future. The program includes plenary lectures, panels, workshops, parallel sessions where participants present research reports, poster exhibitions, and exhibitions of books and other didactical material. Proposals for contributed talks, workshops and posters are due by the extended deadline of March 15, 2024, using the application form posted on the meeting website.  For further information, see also the Second Announcement or contact Snezana Lawrence.
