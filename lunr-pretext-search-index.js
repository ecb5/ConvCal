In the Middle Ages, library collections frequently included astrolabes, quadrants, and sundials alongside treatises explaining their construction and use. Theories of libraries in the Renaissance already anticipated the inclusion of ‘mathematical instruments’. With the emergence of curiosity cabinets, between the 16th and 18th centuries the array of objects was continuously extended. Libraries acquired more and more maps, portraits, coins, medals, natural specimens, models, and exotic artefacts intended to engage with and enrich the libraries’ vast encyclopaedic knowledge.  The presence of a cabinet and the interaction between instruments and books became a crucial material and epistemological concern in the management of libraries, whether private or ‘public’, from the 17th century onwards.  Objects were stored close to books, or in adjoining rooms, and fulfilled various functions. Instruments were regarded as both ornaments and complements to written knowledge, three-dimensional representations of knowledge that could be handled. They therefore played a crucial role in understanding scientific texts, serving as examples or as mnemotechnic tools.  With the exception of a few studies, the presence of instruments in libraries has received little attention in the general history of libraries. The history of education, reading practices, architecture and institutions have taken precedence. The international conference Beyond Books: Instruments and Knowledge in Libraries aims to re-evaluate these historiographical assessments and reconnect libraries, instruments, and books. In a deliberately multidisciplinary and diachronic approach, the event will interrogate the acquisition, status and use of instruments in libraries across different time periods, geographical areas, and knowledge cultures.  Here is a non-comprehensive list of possible topics which may be studied and discussed:  the concept of ‘scientific instrument’ in libraries;   cabinets of curiosities and\/in libraries;    a user-oriented focus on instruments and their possible uses;    scientific practices in libraries and\/or science libraries;    paper and parchment instruments;    biography of instruments (before entering a library collection\/as part of a library collection\/after leaving the library collection);    instruments listed in library catalogues;    library rules and regulations;    furniture, storage procedures, collection management;    curatorial strategies and careers;    conservation and restoration aspects, past and present.     Proposals of 300 words max. — in French or English — should be sent to Rossella Baldi and Samuel Gessner . The deadline for submissions is 15th June 2025.    July 20 24, 2026  The European Summer University on History and Epistemology in Mathematics Education will take place in the Department of Mathematics of the University of Aveiro.     "

Organized by Abe Edwards (Michigan State University) and Ximena Catepillán (Millersville University).     Speaker:   Victor Katz , University of the District of Columbia, Emeritus    Biography:  Victor Katz earned his bachelor's degree from Princeton University in 1963 and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Brandeis University in 1968, focusing on algebra. He served as a professor at Federal City College and later the University of the District of Columbia until his retirement in 2005. Katz is recognized for his significant contributions to the history of mathematics and mathematics education, including authoring a prize-winning textbook, organizing educational workshops, and co-founding the MAA online journal Convergence: Where Mathematics, History, and Teaching Interact .    Abstract:  Recently Clemency Montelle and I completed work on a new Sourcebook in Greek Mathematics. We made great attempts to broaden the definition of Greek mathematics well beyond the normal main characters of Euclid, Archimedes, and Apollonius, although, of course, we had to include lots of material from these authors. But there was more to Greek mathematics than wonderful theorems proved by logical deduction from explicit axioms and definitions. First, when Greek civilization spread over the entire Eastern Mediterranean through the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Greeks encountered other peoples who also studied mathematics. And once the Roman Empire took over this entire region, mathematics continued to be taught and learned, although often not in the Greek language or in the formal Greek manner. In this talk, I will discuss various pieces of mathematics that were not part of formal Greek mathematics but were in fact written about and taught to students in the Eastern Mediterranean region during the period of strongest Greek cultural influence, from approximately 400BCE to 600CE.       8\/7\/26, 9:30 am - 10:50 am, Meeting Room 4  Workshop, Engaging and Inspiring Students in the Mathematics Classroom by Teaching with Primary Source Projects , sponsored by HOM SIGMAA , Euler Society , and TRIUMPHS Society (TRansforming Instruction: Understanding Mathematics via Primary Historical Sources).

Thursday, August 7, 8:00 am - 9:20 am, Meeting Room 3  Workshop, We Integrate Differentials, Not Functions . The organizers propose that starting an Integral Calculus course by defining the integral as the limit of Riemann sums is not only historically inaccurate but more importantly, it is pedagogically unsound. Rigor has its place but its place is not at the beginning of the course where it hinders students use of integration as a problem-solving tool. This workshop will provide examples, problems, and approaches which will demonstrate the power of integrating differentials to solve (not necessarily calculus) problems. It will also provide motivation for the study of power series and ultimately numerical series and sequences as approximation techniques. Rather than treating these as a separate topic, which is often the norm, they can serve to begin the crossover into the abstraction and rigor of Riemann sums and power series.  Examples will be taken from our published OER Calculus textbook Differential Calculus: From Practice to Theory , and our unpublished manuscript Integral Calculus: From Practice to Theory .  Organized by Robert Rogers (SUNY Fredonia) and Eugene (Bud) Boman (Penn State, Harrisburg).

November 18, 2025   The Royal Society will present the conference Women in Science: Historical Perspectives at 6 9 Carlton House Terrace, London. Deadline for submissions: 30 June 2025  March 2025 began the 80th anniversary year of the election of the first two female Fellows of the Royal Society – Kathleen Lonsdale and Marjory Stephenson. This anniversary year is being marked by a series of events looking at the past, present, and future of women in the scientific community. These will include a one-day history of science conference on 18 November 2025 and a two-day contemporary event in early 2026.  For the historical section of this activity in November, we are interested in new research that reflects on contributions, exclusions and collaborations between women collectors, researchers and illustrators from the seventeenth century to the twentieth century. We envisage a half-day on earlier periods, followed by a half-day on nineteenth- and twentieth-century scientists that will pay particular attention to female Fellows of the Royal Society, candidates for Fellowship (actual and potential), those who published or exhibited at the Society, or those supported by Royal Society research grants. However, material reflecting on any aspect of women in science will be considered.  We welcome proposals for 15 to 20 minute papers on themes related to scientific women, including: Hidden or underappreciated individual figures in the history of science. Intellectual networks, salons or societies led by women, whether local, national, or international. Unrecognised contributions by the wives, sisters and daughters of male Fellows of the Royal Society. The Royal Society’s own involvement in including or excluding women from scientific careers. The role of twentieth-century women in STEM in gaining recognition and status both for their own contributions to science and those of other women.  Please submit proposals (not exceeding 300 words, including a biographical note of c.50 words) for 15 to 20 minute papers to library@royalsociety.org by Monday 30 June 2025, with the subject line proposal for conference paper.

In the February talk Bonita Lawrence , Professor Emerita, Marshall University, will speak on Solving Dynamic Equations: Using Gifts from the Past . The Marshall Differential Analyzer Project developed from an idea sparked by a visit to the London Science Museum’s display of historic differential analyzer machines. The primary goal of the project was to offer an alternative perspective, and hence an enhanced understanding, of the behavior of solutions to dynamic equations. As our study and the construction of our machines progressed, we found that the dynamic motion of the machine’s components and the sounds created offered observers an amazing physical connection to the “programed” mathematical equation. Through the years, our machines have been used to teach students about modeling physical systems with dynamic equations, for research studies, and to offer prospective students an alternative view of our mathematical structure.This presentation will begin with some discussion of the history of the development of these machines and of our own project. A general overview of the primary components of the machine and the relationship between the mechanics and the mathematics being modeled will follow. The big finale will be a live streaming of a run of the large four integrator machine, complete with a discussion of the link between the physical connections between the components and the differential equation under consideration. All seminar talks will begin at 6:30 pm ET.  Contact Alan Gluchoff for parking or Zoom details.
